# Bangla Multiclass Cyberbullying Classification

This project aims to classify cyberbullying content in Bangla into six distinct categories using advanced machine learning techniques. The classification model combines **BanglaBERT**, a language model specifically designed for Bangla text, with a **BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)** network to enhance performance and accuracy. Additionally, the project incorporates explainable AI techniques to provide insights into the model's decision-making process, making the results more interpretable. This approach facilitates better understanding and analysis of cyberbullying content in Bangla, contributing to improved online safety and moderation. This is just a codebase for my masters course on natural laguage processing.
